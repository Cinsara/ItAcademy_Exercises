# Java Exercises: File Handling, Serialization, and Directory Management üìÇ

This repository contains Java exercises focused on working with file handling, directory management, and object serialization. Below is a breakdown of the exercises and their objectives.

---

## üß† Level 1: Directory and File Handling

### Exercise 1: Directory Listing

#### Tasks:
1. Create a class that lists the contents of a directory alphabetically.
2. The directory path should be received as a parameter.

---

### Exercise 2: Recursive Directory Tree Listing

#### Tasks:
1. Extend the previous class to list the contents of all levels of a directory tree recursively.
2. Print the contents in alphabetical order within each level.
3. Indicate whether each item is a directory (D) or a file (F).
4. Display the last modification date of each item.

---

### Exercise 3: Save Directory Tree to a File

#### Tasks:
1. Modify the previous exercise to save the directory tree listing into a `.txt` file instead of printing it to the console.

---

### Exercise 4: Read and Display TXT File Content

#### Tasks:
1. Add functionality to read any `.txt` file and display its content in the console.

---

### Exercise 5: Java Object Serialization and Deserialization

#### Tasks:
1. Implement functionality to serialize a Java object into a `.ser` file.
2. Implement functionality to deserialize the object from the `.ser` file.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the Java source files.
    - `DirectoryClass.java`: Main class implementing directory listing, file handling, and serialization.
- `directory_saved.txt`: Example output file for the directory tree listing.
- `object.ser`: Example serialized object file.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main` class or the specific exercise class to test the functionality.
4. Explore the classes to understand the implementation details.

## üìù Notes

- Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
- The exercises are designed to help you practice working with file handling, directory management, and object serialization in Java.
