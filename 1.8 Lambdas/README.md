# üìö Java Lambdas

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises designed to practice and deepen your understanding of Java Lambdas and Streams (Java 8+). Each exercise includes practical challenges to explore lambda functions, method references, and functional interfaces.

## üöÄ Exercise List  

### üìù Level 1  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Filter Strings by Character 'o'**  
- **Task:** Create a method that returns a list of strings containing the letter 'o'. Print the result.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Filter Strings with Character 'o' and Length Greater than 5**  
- **Task:** Modify the previous exercise to return only the strings that contain the letter 'o' and have more than five characters. Print the result.  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Print Months of the Year Using a Lambda**  
- **Task:** Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Print each element using a lambda expression.  

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Print Months Using Method References**  
- **Task:** Repeat the previous exercise, but print the elements using method references instead of lambdas.  

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Functional Interface for Pi Value**  
- **Task:** Create a functional interface with a method named `getPiValue()` that returns a `double`. In the main method, assign the value `3.1415` to the interface and invoke the method, printing the result.  

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Sort List by String Length (Ascending)**  
- **Task:** Create a list containing both numbers and text strings. Sort the list by string length from shortest to longest.  

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Sort List by String Length (Descending)**  
- **Task:** Using the list from the previous exercise, now sort it from the longest to the shortest string.  

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Reverse Strings with Functional Interface**  
- **Task:** Create a functional interface with a method named `reverse()` that takes and returns a `String`. Inject a lambda implementation in the main method that returns the reverse of the input string. Invoke the interface with a test string and verify the result.
